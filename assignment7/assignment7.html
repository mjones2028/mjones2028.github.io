			  <p> The fictitious organization that would promote this truth would be a private conspiracy group of lobbyists with money. With this type of influence, this could cause another Area 51 raid but in ‘Area 52’ but for this raid to come together, money would of course be considered of me because I cannot get anything out of something. With the continuous addition of raiding Area 51, I would additionally add the person who thought of all of it to come together and create the conspiracy that would rather be more connective to the Government hiding stuff. </p>
			  <p> I would release a book describing the past conspiracy theories regarding Aliens and Area 51 and ‘connect the dots’ to Wyoming being a second base considering that anyone that was here during the time of the raid knows that Area 51 exists, and the government really has stuff to hide from the public. I would then use the organization as a further publicity stunt, put money into publishing and further spreading the info, even worldwide if I must. It could become a remarkable sight but also a swindle where no one gets anything out of going to the Wyoming mountains and waterfalls to see no governmental base. 	 </p>
