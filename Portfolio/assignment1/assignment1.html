				In the essay 404 Page Not Found by Kate Wagner, she discusses the general topic of the evolution of the internet. With a little bit of background information from her, she starts her essay with the nostalgia that the internet intrigued in her in 1998 (Wagner 2019, Para.1).

				Based off the History article titled “the Invention of the Internet” by Amanda Onion and other editors of History.com, the internet’s birth occurred in the 1960s. With this information in addition to certain details in Wagner’s introduction, it can be inferred that her generation or Millennials, was the intermediary generation in the evolution of the internet. She continues her nostalgia with providing a little background on how the internet was first introduced to her. This was introduced by her father who at the time was working in the federal government, leading to the result of internet usage by her household (Wagner 2019, Para.2). All of this was followed by examples given by Wagner regarding the many websites and social platforms born from the internet and inducted into her transition from childhood into early adulthood. Those examples consisted of Neopets, Myspace, Facebook, Instagram and so many more platforms that were created by the users of the internet (Wagner 2019, Para. 2). In the final understanding of her nostalgia, she expresses her emotion regarding internet pre-social media. This provides an index to the ending of her nostalgia as well as many who at the time had dealt with that time of internet. But she also gives kudos to the extensive use of social media and its involvement in her creativity post existence of Myspace and its transition to other social platforms.

				Later in the essay, Wagner introduces the idea of Vaporwave and the influence of it behind the earlier days of internet and the Millennial days of style. This time of convo about Vaporwave, it reintroduced Wagner’s nostalgia into the conversation past everything regarding the process it took the internet to get to where it was at the time of the written essay. While in the early days of Instagram, Wagner convened comparison of Vaporwave to the colors and styles of Gifs and pictures seen on Instagram. Based on what Wager states regarding the near death of Vaporwave, “The critique offered by vaporwave—its defiant sense of utopia—was immediately and effectively erased, leaving only a commodified, nostalgic aesthetic” (Wagner 2019, Para. 27). Due to vaporwave, it led to years of aesthetic for the 1990s timeline.

				In conclusion, the internet's evolution has shown the many influences of life and how everything affects anyone in contact with the internet. The overall essay of Kate Wagner helped me realize a lot about the future of the internet and how it can have similar and different effects on the different generations that have been in the century of internet use. As a member of Generation Z, it is inferred by many of previous generations how much internet is used by individuals in Gen Z. In other words, “digital natives” as Kate Wagner deemed herself to be for her time of the internet’s evolution. In today’s time the evolution has led to AI and with it, comes many pros and cons as weel as the 100s of social platforms used to Gen Z and Gen Alpha. My experience with the internet has been indulging with every step of my life, from social media to personal gain. Sometimes it can become an addiction but if it gets utilized the right way it can have its positive effects. Due to the generation’s state of being technology savvy. I learned from Wagner that the difference in our nostalgia shows how different the internet has influenced the generations overtime.
