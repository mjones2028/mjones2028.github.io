			<p>Hello! Im Mondell Jones, a current freshman at Columbia College Chciago with a major in Programming. My overall life interest is engaged around music, but not everyone makes it into the “big leagues” which leads me to the idea of not getting my hopes up. I am a growing church musician who plays drums, piano and organ. I only know so much and I can only study so much due to lack of resources and time. As an ultimatum for my growth, I plan to continue the use of my musicianship by trying to play in college bands. There are a lot of opportunities here at Columbia and a lot of bands. I additionally feel that this can really push me out there although I am a shy-ish person. </p>
