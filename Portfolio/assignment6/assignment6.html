				<h1>Sara Shabita "Opinion: There needs to be a line for Gen Zâ€™s unseriousness"</h1>

				<p>
					Although it is definitely important to change work culture from the soul-sucking corporate 9-to-5, there is a fine line when it comes to behavior in the workplace. Some humorous office emails can lighten up the mood every so often, but when Gen Z begins to make up most of the workforce and Gen Z quirks become the norm, it can hurt workplace professionalism. These quirks can disrupt workplace hierarchies and in turn boundaries, causing organizations to lose credibility.
				</p>
				<p>
					If Gen Z continues this relationship with professional environments, it could lead to a murky understanding of relationships in the workplace and difficulties in promotions. Despite genuine competency, casual and informal behavior can result in negative perceptions. In a casual environment with no differentiation of levels, it also becomes difficult to establish authority and leadership, blurring lines of hierarchy and burying rising potential, which may unintentionally take away opportunities from people.

				<h2> My Opinion</h2>
				<p>
					When it comes to unprofessionalism, its considered the opposite of professionalism. In today's time, professionals are mostly made up of people from generations that come before Millenials and Zoomers. Although many can agree on the fact that culture in working needs to change, some can also disagree. With many sources and sitings that consist of older generations and the probability of those who feel that Generation Zoomers aren't cut out to work, it can be opposed to the diversity that is brung to the table by the Generation. As an unemployed member of the generation, I am learning from both sides of the situation. For the most part, I stand with my generation as a means to change certain ethics that may have been accepted by certain generations who isnt predominantly known for their social activism or population.
				</p>
				<p>
					Falling back on unprofessionalism, a part of work ethic changing is normalizing some aspects that the older generation would consider unprofessional. Though I agree to an extent on certain aspects of unprofessionalism from my generation, certain actions can be taken so that we wont stay in this area of being downsized by the older generations. I feel that it needs to be normalized where certain training is introduced and implemented so that this 'unprofessionalism' isnt continued or publicized to the face of what my generation is worth. With these trainings, certain action and slang can be removed and be disclosed so that consumers or customers wont feel as though Gen Z workers are being unprofessional. Though there is a bigger picure behind the issue, something that could be agreed out of this is not everything is meant to stay the same.
